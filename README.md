<h2>Smart Pension Ruby Test</h2>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
To run the program, please use the 'main.rb' file which is in the ruby_app directory.

There are two methods 'Most page views' and 'Most unique page views'.
Currently, it doesn't run those two methods at the same time so,
I suggest to run each method one by one by commenting out.

For example, to find the most page views:-

```
puts 'List of Web Pages with Most Page Views'\
p parse.most_views

<!-- puts 'List of Web Pages with Most Unique Views'
p parse.unique_views -->
```

and to find the most unique page views:-

```
<!-- puts 'List of Web Pages with Most Page Views'
p parse.most_views -->

puts 'List of Web Pages with Most Unique Views'\
p parse.unique_views
```

In terms of how I have approached the problems and the process of solutions,
I have written draft pseudo code on the goolge docs so, if you would like to find out more,

Finally, I was currently working on the Testing but, due to time-limit, I couldn't write one for now but, I will write the test when I am available after submission.

Thanks very much and if you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me via email.
