<h2>Smart Pension Ruby Test</h2>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
To run the program, please use the 'main.rb' file which is in the ruby_app directory.

There are two methods 'Most page views' and 'Most unique page views'.
Currently, it doesn't run those two methods at the same time so,
I suggest to run each method one by one by commenting out.

For example, to find the most page views:-

'''
puts 'List of Web Pages with Most Page Views'
p parse.most_views

<!-- puts 'List of Web Pages with Most Unique Views'
p parse.unique_views -->
'''

and to find the most unique page views:-

'''
<!-- puts 'List of Web Pages with Most Page Views'
p parse.most_views -->

puts 'List of Web Pages with Most Unique Views'
p parse.unique_views
'''

In terms of how I have approached the problems and the process of solutions,
I have written draft pseudo code on the goolge docs so, if you would like to find out more,

Finally, I was currently working on the Testing but, due to time-limit and as well as I don't know the expected outcome of the counts of most page views and unique views, it was bit abstract to write the testing from the beginning.

Given more time, after submitting this challenge, I will try to work on adding some Testing by researching and studying.

Thanks very much and if you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me via email.
