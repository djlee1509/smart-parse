<h2>Smart Pension Ruby Test</h2>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
To run the program, please use the 'main.rb' file which is in the ruby_app directory.

There are two methods 'most_views' and 'unique_views'.
You can run the methods by commenting out each different method to see what the outcome is.

For example, to find the most page views:-

```
puts 'List of Web Pages with Most Page Views'\
p parse.most_views

<!-- puts 'List of Web Pages with Most Unique Views'
p parse.unique_views -->
```

and to find the most unique page views:-

```
<!-- puts 'List of Web Pages with Most Page Views'
p parse.most_views -->

puts 'List of Web Pages with Most Unique Views'\
p parse.unique_views
```

In terms of how I have approached the problems and the process of solutions,
I have written draft pseudo code on the goolge docs so, if you would like to find out more,
please find the link below:-

Update: I just have written some tests but, some of the tests are successful while others are failed. But, I can't figure out why other two are failed at the moment. I will update it if I see that I made a mistake at some point later if given chance.

In terms of the testing, I have created additional two files: 'onewebserver.log' and 'tenwebserver.log' which picked one line and tens lines accordingly from the 'webserver.log' file for testing purpose.

To run the testing, you can run the testing by typing the following command when you are at the right directory.

```
ruby testing.rb
```

Thanks very much and if you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me via email.
